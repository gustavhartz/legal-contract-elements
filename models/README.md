# Model checkpoints
--------
The models have fairly little training (15 epoch) which can be obtained in 4-5 hours of training using a Nvidia Tesla K80 thus the state checkpoints have been ommitted from the repo. The DrQA checkpoint for SQuAD and BiDAF for CUAD can be found [here](https://dtudk-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/s174315_dtu_dk/Documents/Models.zip?csf=1&web=1&e=FPiNHa) (you might need to request access due to DTU it policy)
